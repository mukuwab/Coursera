# useState hook
-works with state in React components

# Array Destructuring
- way to get individual items from an array of items
  and save those individual items as seperate components

  Example
    
    let veggies = [parsley, onion, carrot];
    const [v1 , v2 , v3] = veggies
    //v1 is the first item in the veggie array

    console.log(v1); //parsely
    console.log(v2); //onion
    console.log(v3); //carrot

    
    
    you can give the destructured variables any name


# Object Destructuring
- when destructuring objects, you have to destructure a property of an object using that exact properties name as the name of the destructured variable
- stricter rules when naming the destructured variables


useState hook - array data structure used as return value
