## Key Terms

Version Control: A system that helps developers manage changes to source code over time, facilitating collaboration among multiple developers.

Continuous Integration (CI): A practice that automates the integration of code changes from multiple developers, reducing merge conflicts by merging small changes frequently.

Workflow: A structured process that outlines how code changes are managed, including conflict resolution and code review practices.

Continuous Delivery (CD): An advanced practice that automates the preparation of applications for deployment, ensuring they are always in a deployable state.

Continuous Deployment: An extension of Continuous Delivery that automates the deployment of applications to production without manual intervention.




Version Control plays a crucial part in software development. As a developer, you’ll work with other developers on projects to deliver software to customers. Depending on the role, you could be working with a small team of 2 or 3 developers in a single project or a large team spanning multiple projects. In either scenario, Version Control will be a crucial tool to help your team succeed.

However, Version Control must be complemented by other tools and procedures to ensure quality and efficiency throughout the software development process. In this lesson, we’ll explore some of the common tools and strategies developers use in conjunction with Version Control.

## Workflow
Using Version Control without a proper workflow is like building a city without traffic lights; without appropriate management, everything will turn into chaos.

For example, let’s say you’re working on a big project and editing a file. Another developer also starts editing a file. Both of you submit the file to the VCS at the same time. Now there’s a conflict! How should the conflict be resolved? A good workflow will have a process for resolving conflicts.

Another example is when a new junior developer is joining your team. If the project code is used for a critical system, it is risky to allow them to submit code changes directly. To solve this, many developers use a peer review system where another developer must review code before it can be merged in.

Workflows are essential to ensure code is managed correctly and reduce mistakes from happening. Different projects will have different workflows. In this course, you’ll learn some common workflows using the Git Version Control System.

## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration, or CI, is used to automate the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single main stream. Using a workflow whereby small changes are merged frequently, often many times per day, will reduce the number of merge conflicts.

This process is widespread in test-driven software development strategies. CI is often used to automatically compile the project and run tests on every code change to ensure that the build remains stable and prevent regressions in functionality.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is an advanced practice built on top of Continuous Integration. In this approach, once changes are merged into the main codebase, a Continuous Delivery pipeline automates the process of preparing the application for deployment. This process includes tasks like building the application, running tests, and packaging it for deployment to a production-like environment.

The main goal of Continuous Delivery is to ensure that the application is always in a deployable state, even after multiple changes by different developers. By automating these steps, Continuous Delivery eliminates the risk of human errors during the packaging process and reduces delays in getting the application ready for deployment. However, Continuous Delivery requires manual approval to release the application to the production environment. Although this gives teams greater control over when and how changes are deployed to live systems, Continuous Delivery is slower than Continuous Deployment because of this manual step.

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery a step further by automating the actual deployment of the application to production. With this practice, every change that passes through automated tests and validations in the pipeline is automatically deployed to production without the need for manual intervention.

The strategy involves deploying to a staging environment first, where additional checks or validations might occur, and then promoting the changes to the live production environment. Unlike Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment eliminates the manual approval step, making it faster and more efficient. This approach ensures that updates, features, and fixes are delivered to customers as soon as they are ready, fostering rapid and iterative delivery. Continuous Deployment is ideal for teams that prioritize speed and frequent releases over manual control.

Automation is the key difference that sets Continuous Deployment apart from Continuous Delivery. These two deployment types can be used together in a pipeline or adopted independently, depending on the organization’s processes and requirements. When used together, the Continuous Delivery steps ensure the code is production-ready after passing all tests and reviews. The Continuous Deployment then automates the final step of deploying production-ready code without manual intervention. Using them together in a production environment provides an additional safety layer but also increases the time required.

## Conclusion
With these tools and procedures, it is possible to understand how software starts from a developer writing code to being deployed live for customers to use. Of course, there is much more to running a live software service, but that is a lesson for another day.
