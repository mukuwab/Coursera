## Introduction:

As a developer, working with the command line is a critical skill you'll use daily. The command line allows you to interact with your system efficiently, perform tasks, and manage files and projects. One of the first steps when starting in the command line is identifying your current working directory. This ensures you know where you are in the file system.

In this lab, you’ll practice using the pwd (Print Working Directory) command to display your current directory.

## Goal:

Learn how to use the pwd command to determine and understand your current working directory in the command line interface. 

## Objectives: 

Execute the pwd command to check the current working directory.

Understand the output provided by the pwd command.

## Learner Instructions:   

Step 1: Open a Terminal: 
Open the terminal by navigating to the Terminal menu and selecting New Terminal.

Step 2: Use the pwd command:

|    $ pwd

In the terminal, type the pwd command.

Press Enter.

Step 3: Observe the output:
Note the path displayed in the terminal. This represents your current working directory.
Example output might look like: /home/coder/project 

Step 4: Reflect:
Understand that the working directory is the starting point for all relative file paths and actions performed in the terminal. 

Tips:
Be cautious of case sensitivity: The terminal differentiates between lowercase and uppercase characters.

Correct mistakes with backspace: If you mistype the command, use the backspace key to fix it before pressing Enter.

## Key Takeaways:
The pwd command is a fundamental tool for verifying your current working directory in the command line.

Knowing your working directory helps you navigate the file system effectively and execute commands with confidence.

The terminal is a case-sensitive environment, so commands must be typed accurately.
