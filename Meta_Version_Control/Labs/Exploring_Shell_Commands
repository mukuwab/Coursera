In this lab, you will:

Count Words in a File

Redirect Errors to a File

Search for Substrings in a File 

1. Count Words in a File :

 1.1 Create  a new file 'file.txt' and write the string "Welcome to Unix Shell Programming " into it.

##    touch file.txt

echo "Welcome to Unix Shell Programming"  >> file.txt

touch command creates a new file 

The string "Welcome to Unix Shell Programming " will be written to the file  using >>  redirection operator.

1.2 Use the cat command to display the content of a file and pipe it to wc -w to count the number of words in the file.  

##    cat file.txt | wc -w

 cat file.txt:  Outputs the content of file.txt to the standard output.

wc -w: Counts the words from the input.

2.  Redirect Errors to a File  

 2.1 List the contents of a non-existent directory and save the error message to a file

 ##   ls -l /bin/directory-that-does-not-exist 2> error.txt

 ls -l /bin/directory-that-does-not-exist: Tries to list the directory.

Redirects standard error (stderr) to error.txt.

 2.2  Count the number of characters in the error.txt file

 ##   wc -c < error.txt

 3. Search for Substrings in a File  

 Use the grep command to find and count words in a file that partially match a specified substring.  

echo " Unix is a powerful operating system. Learning unix  commands is very much essential to work on a Unix based system" >> file.txt

##  grep -i -w Unix file.txt | wc -w

 grep -i  Unix file.txt: Finds all lines in file.txt that contain the substring Unix, ignoring case (-i).

wc -w: Counts the words in the matched lines.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Count words and characters in files using cat and wc.

Redirect error messages to a file and analyze them.

Search for substrings in files with grep and count matches.

Gain foundational skills in text processing and file handling in a Unix environment.
