Task:
You've learned that you can add another component inside the App component, and then render that new component inside the App component's return statement.

In this exercise, you'll practice doing just that. You will be instructed, step by step, to build a new component inside the App component, and to have it rendered on the screen.

Note: Before you begin, make sure you understand how to work with the 
Coursera Code Lab for the React Basics
 course.

Steps:
Step 1
 Add a new component to the App component, named Heading.   

Navigate to the src folder and find the App.js file. Click on the App.js file in the EXPLORER to have it open.

Now you're ready to add a new component to the App component and name that component Heading. Place it at the very top of the App.js file.

Step 2
 Inside the Heading component, include a return statement, which will return the JSX code.  

Step 3
To the right of the return keyword, add the following JSX code: <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1> that displays the H1 element on the screen.

Step 4

Running your code:

At the top of the lab environment, locate the Terminal menu. Click on it to open a dropdown, then select New Terminal. Use the npm start command to start the development server.

If you encounter errors like File not found or Unexpected token, in the terminal, stop the server with Ctrl + C and restart it using npm start.

You can now view the App in your lab browser. To view the output, click on the Browser Preview icon located on the left panel. It is the last icon in the panel.


When your lab browser has launched, enter: http://localhost:3000 in the address bar to see the output. Run your code using the play button at the top right of your lab. You should see the heading, "This is an h1 heading", rendered on the screen.
