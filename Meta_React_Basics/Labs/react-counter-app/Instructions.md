Introduction:    

The lab will focus on how to build a simple counter application using React. This counter will start with a value of 0 and have buttons to increase and decrease the value by 1. You'll practice using state in React with the useState hook and handle basic user interactions through event handlers. By the end of this lab, you will have a functional counter app and a better understanding of how to manage state in React.  

Goal:    

To build a simple counter app in React that:

Starts with an initial value of 0.

Increases the value by 1 when the "Add 1" button is clicked.

Decreases the value by 1 when the "Subtract 1" button is clicked.

Objectives:  

By the end of this lab, learners will:  

Learn how to use the useState hook to create and manage state in functional components.

Practice handling user input (button clicks) to trigger state changes.

Understand how to update the state dynamically using event handlers.

Learn how to use JSX to display and render updated state in a React component.

Apply best practices for building interactive and dynamic React applications.
