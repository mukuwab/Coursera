# Key Concepts

External CSS: Using the <link> HTML element in the index.html file to load CSS styles that can be accessed via the className attribute in JSX.

Inline Styles: Applying styles directly within JSX elements using the style attribute, which requires a JavaScript object for styling properties.

Style Object Literal: A JavaScript object that defines CSS properties in camelCase format, allowing for dynamic styling within JSX components.



You’ve observed that JSX is incredibly versatile, and can accept a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  In this reading, you'll learn some approaches for styling JSX elements and doing so in a way that achieves both a functional and visual aspect within an app.

There are various ways to style JSX elements.

Probably the simplest way to do this is using the link HTML element in the head of the index.html file in which your React app will mount.

The href attribute loads some CSS styles, probably with some CSS classes, and then, inside the function component's declarations, you can access those CSS classes using the className attribute.

function Promo(props) {
    return (
        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1>{props.heading}</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

In CSS:

.promo-section {
    font-weight: bold;
    line-height: 20px;
}


Another way to add CSS styles to components is using inline styles.

The syntax of inline styles in JSX is a bit custom.

Consider a starting Promo component, containing code that you encountered earlier:


function Promo(props) {
    return (
        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1>{props.heading}</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Promo;



Now you can add some inline styles to it:


function Promo(props) {
    return (
        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1 style={{color:"tomato", fontSize:"40px", fontWeight:"bold"}}>
                    {props.heading}
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Promo;

function Promo(props) {

        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1 style={{color:"tomato", fontSize:"40px", fontWeight:"bold"}}>
                    {props.heading}
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Promo;



You can start updating the Promo component by adding the JavaScript expression syntax:


<h1 style={}>


As explained previously, this means that whatever code you add inside these opening and closing curly braces is to be parsed as regular JavaScript. Now let’s add a style object literal inside of these curly braces:


<h1 style={{color:"tomato",fontSize:"40px"}}>



Styling JSX elements

Another way to add CSS styles to components is using inline styles.

The syntax of inline styles in JSX is a bit custom.

Consider a starting Promo component, containing code that you encountered earlier:

    return (

                <h1>{props.heading}</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Promo;
Now you can add some inline styles to it:

13141516
function Promo(props) {
    return (
        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1 style={{color:"tomato", fontSize:"40px", fontWeight:"bold"}}>
                    {props.heading}
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Promo;
You can start updating the Promo component by adding the JavaScript expression syntax:

1
<h1 style={}>
As explained previously, this means that whatever code you add inside these opening and closing curly braces is to be parsed as regular JavaScript. Now let’s add a style object literal inside of these curly braces:

1
<h1 style={{color:"tomato",fontSize:"40px"}}>


You can then re-write this object literal:




So, there's nothing special about this object, except for the fact that you’ve inlined it and placed it inside a pair of curly braces. Additionally, since it's just JavaScript, those CSS properties that would be hyphenated in plain CSS, such as, for example, font-size:40px, become camelCased, and the value is a string, making it look like this: fontSize:"40px".

Besides inlining a style object literal, you can also save it in a variable, and then use that variable instead of passing an object literal.

That gives you an updated Promo component, with the styles object saved as a JavaScript variable:



function Promo(props) {

const styles = {
    color: "tomato",
    fontSize: "40px"
}

return (
        <div className="promo-section">
            <div>
                <h1 style={styles}>
                    {props.heading}
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>{props.promoSubHeading}</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}



Using this approach makes your components more self-contained, because they come with their own styles built-in, but it also makes them a bit harder to maintain.
